A stock dividend is important because it is a dividend payment made in the form of additional shares rather than an actual cash payout. Many companies who are short on liquid cash will distribute this dividend to shareholders. In other words, stocks are distributed among the shareholders. Many investors find this appealing because it presents the oppertunity to generate equity.</br>
This can be calculated by using the following equation:</br>
Stock Dividend Distributable = (Stock Dividend Percentage / 100) x (Number of shares) x (Par Value) </br>
Stock dividend percentage is the percentage one will earn off of the stock. </br>
This can be calculated by dividing the annual dividend share by the price of the shares.</br>
